## Game Rules

2048 is often played on a gray 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that 
slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys.
Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until 
they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. 
If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will 
merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided.

The game ends when a tile with a value of 2048 appears on the board, 
hence the name of the game.
When the player has no legal moves (there are no empty spaces 
and no adjacent tiles with the same value), the game ends.
